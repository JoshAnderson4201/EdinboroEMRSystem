<div id="about">

This system is used by the Edinboro University of Pennsylvania Nursing Students in order to help familiarize themselves with EMR systems they are likely to use throughout their careers. It is not mean for use in a professional setting, and is currently only an education tool. Students can create new EMR's for patients, view and edit previous EMR's, and view their grades.
